# Changelog

All notable Fleck product changes are recorded here. Packaging a new build without changing
the product does not add a changelog entry.

## [1.0.2-beta.1] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- Restored the prior Notes editor polish from source commit
  `cc6fcfb6b9955eab9de4d3a902e8be9fe33e0b44`: editor content is clipped to the panel bounds,
  the font-family trigger remains readable at full and compact widths, and compact toolbar
  spacing is tightened.

## [1.0.1-beta.1] - 2026-09-12

### Changed

- New app bundles, handoff folders, launchers, and ZIPs use their captured product version and
  build number in the artifact name.
- Packaging consumers use per-invocation result files instead of fixed or newest-build paths.

## [1.0.0-beta.1] - 2026-09-11

### Added

- Added durable product-version and packaged-build identity metadata.
- Added native build information in Settings → About with a copy action.
- Added canonical accepted-baseline verification to Fleck packaging workflows.
